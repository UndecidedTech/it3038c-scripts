Imgmodify
======
This is a command line tool that works as a wrapper to the javascript image library called Sharp. This wrapper allows you to blur images, resize, rotate, and change the file type.

Type node index.js imgmodify -h for help.

Usage Example:
```bash
node index.js imgmodify -i your-path-to-image -w width-in-pixels -h height-in-pixels -t file-extension-to-output -r degrees-to-rotate
```
