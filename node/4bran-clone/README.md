### **4BRAN**

Idea: Recreating the anonymous image board 4chan/4channel using Vue components and NodeJS.

*I was only able to implement the creation of one thread, which will reset every 10 minutes*

# Usage

You need two terminals running, one for backend, one for frontend.

Inside first terminal:
```bash
cd it3038c-scripts/node/4bran-clone/frontend/4bran
npm install
npm run serve
```
Then navigate to localhost:8080, or whatever port Vue hosts on by default

Inside second terminal: 
```bash
cd it3038c-scripts/node/4bran-clone/backend/4bran
npm install
npm run dev
```
